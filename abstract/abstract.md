## Continuous Delivery like you feel no fear

Everybody does some Continous Integration, but I think a modern CD pipeline can change the way we are collaborating while building Software. Let's push the boundaries of what Continous Delivery can be in reality: At Matmatch we're doing a bunch of cool things with Gitlab and Kubernetes: Every Branch gets deployed and has it's own URL - and the Product Manager or the Stakeholder releases every feature directly to production as soon as it is ready. Goodbye test systems, good riddance staging, our software hits the ground running.

Why did we as a small startup bother with pushing that system to it's limits? To get faster Feedback and to minimize Risk! Since we have that in place we are releasing faster, failing faster and learning faster. It's a joy to work that way and I could never go back.

In this talk I will walk you through our pipeline, the hickups we had along the way and the benefits we get from that. Afterwards, you might be highly annoyed by your own release process!
